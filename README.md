Medication tracker application.
The user puts in the medication and sets amount to take, days and times to take and if applicable, the date the medication course ends. 
Should have functionality to save a picture of the medication. 
In the tracking section the medication is displayed with a check box to indicate whether the medication has been taken that day. The user should be able to look at their medication taking history.

Sponsor is Mrs. Mott - She is invested in this app because of her need to be consistent and on time with her medication.
